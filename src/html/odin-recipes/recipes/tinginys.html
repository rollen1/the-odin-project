    <h3>Description</h3>

    <hr>

    <p>
        This easy to make and laziest dessert ever is liked by everyone. In Lithuania it's called "tinginys", which
        means "sloth". The recipe was passed down to me from my mom who doesn't like working in the kitchen. This recipe
        also has a lot of variations but this is the most common, traditional version.
