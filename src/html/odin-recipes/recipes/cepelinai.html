    <h3>Description</h3>
    
    <hr>

    <p>
        Cepelinai (pronounced sep-elle-in-ay) are a delicious type of potato and meat dumpling from Lithuanian. They get
        their name due to their zeppelin-like shape (cepelinai is zeppelin in Lithuanian).

        Made with mouthwateringly savory meat filling wrapped in tender potato dough, cepelinai are typically served
        with a delicious gravy, crumbled bacon, and sour cream. They were originally known as didžkukuliai, but were
        renamed for Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin.

        <li>Chopped fresh dill and parsley, to taste, if desired</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <hr>

    <ol>
        <li>Boil 1/3 of the potatoes for 15 minutes, or until tender.</li>
        <li>Drain, and allow the potatoes to cool. Peel, then mash and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, combine the meat, onion, salt, pepper, parsley, and dill. Cover and place in the fridge.</li>
        <li>Peel the remaining 2/3 of the potatoes. Finely grate them with a box grater.</li>
        <li>Place the potatoes onto a clean paper towel.</li>
        <li>Squeeze the juices into a bowl, and set aside for about 5 minutes so the heavier starches can settle to the
            bottom of the bowl.</li>
        <li>In a second bowl, combine the mashed potatoes, grated potatoes, salt, and dry potato starch.</li>
        <li>Discard the top layer of watery potato juice. Add the sediment at the bottom of the bowl to the potatoes.
            Mix well.</li>
        <li>Boil salted water in a large pot.</li>
        <li>Divide the potato dough into 6 equal parts. Form one piece into a flat disc.</li>
        <li>Place a tablespoon of the filling in the center. Fold the disk over and crimp the edges to seal the
            dumpling. Repeat with remaining dough.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, place the dumplings in the boiling water.</li>
        <li>Cook for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove with a slotted spoon.</li>
        <li>To make the sauce, sauté the onions in butter and 2 tablespoons of bacon grease.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper. Cook for 5 to 7 minutes, until golden.</li>
        <li>Pour the sauce over the dumplings. Add a spoonful of sour cream and garnish with crumbled bacon.</li>
    </ol>
